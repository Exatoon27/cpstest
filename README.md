# CPS Tester
This is a straightforward program to test clicks per second.The program was made to compile with rust. Therefore, the final program will be a binary exportable to Windows, macOS, or Linux with the same code and without any problem. In addition, it uses gtk-rs to draw the UI and to be compatible with more than one platform.

> The program is only for learning how to use rust and gtk, so don't expect the program to be spectacular.

## Used technology
- Rust - Is the language used.
- Gtk-rs - Is the library used to draw the UI.
